CMPE130 Project (Search Engine)

This is a text file search engine created for a data structures and algorithms class. 

All the operations in this project are meant to simulate a live web search engine like Google or Bing.
The indexer.py file contains functions that collects links to textfiles from a textfile website, collect some basic
metadata on the files it finds and stores that in a local db. Then when the user enters a query via the web application,
the program searches the database and presents relevant links ranked by the relevancy.
